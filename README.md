#Styln'

Today, people seek to know what clothing is in-style verses clothing that is on its way out. With our software, we hope to simplify this process by compiling user data into one place. Modeling after Instagram/Pinterest/Billboard/Spotify, our software will provide users with the information and customizability that will allow them to create their best digital wardrobes.
